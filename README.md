# aixingBot
 A Python based Discord Bot.
 
 This is very much still a work in progress as it has been developed primarily as a learning tool (there is no harm in coming up with cool features and improvement, though).

## Thinking of contributing?

Please create an issue first detailing what features or improvements you wish to make. We would also ask that you stick to the PEP8 guildlines in your coding; e.g
- DO ``` def something(arg1, arg2) ``` vs 
- DO NOT ``` def something(arg1,arg2) ```
- DO ``` users = something ``` vs 
- DO NOT ``` users=something ```
